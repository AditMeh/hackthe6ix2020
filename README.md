# Inspiration 💭⚡

Ever listen to your favourite artists🧑‍🎤 and songs⏭️ and think **"Damn, I wish there was similar music to this?"** We have this exact feeling, which is why we have developed SongSmith for the Music loving people!🧑‍🤝‍🧑


# How We built it 🏢
## Tech Stack 🔨
- SongSmith was built using the latest and great technology!! 💻
- Our **music generative neural network** was developed using a state of the art architecture called **Attention Mechanism Networks**. 
- AI Model: Tensorflow, Keras, Google Colab
- BackEnd: Express.js, Flask to run our **microservices**, and inference servers. 
- FrontEnd: Developed using React.js, and Bootstrap; to allow for a quick **MVP development cycle**.
- Storage: MongoDB, Firebase, Firestore
- Moral Support: Coffee, Bubble Tea, Pizza and **Passion for AI** <3

# Challenges I ran into 🧱🤔

- Converting the output from the neural network to a playable format in the browser
- Allowing for CORS interaction between the frontend and our microservices

# What I learned🏫

- Bleeding💉 Edge Generative Neural Network for Music🎙️Production
- Different Python🐍 and Node.js Music Production Related Libraries📚

# What's next for SongSmith ➡️
- Offering wider genres of music to attract wider **music-loving users**!🧑‍🎤
- Refining our Neural Network to generate more **superb quality REMIXES**!
